# RadioSpoon Radio Station.
By Holland Sersen, Andrada Iorgulescu and Jordan Drummond

# HOW TO PLAY
Mac uses PortAudio. Code might need to be edited depending on platform. 
To play run this line of code 

**liquidsoap ./script.liq**

This will play the Radio staion in its entiretly 

# If you are not on Mac
Please change port audio to which ever audio driver your platform supports. 

## All Audio should be in ./Audio
The script should play through A play list randomly. Then the next playlist randomly. And then then thenext.
At the same time play a random jingle every 3 mintues. 

## Naming
I should have named everything lowercase. I realized this as soon as I finished. So just know that when editing.
